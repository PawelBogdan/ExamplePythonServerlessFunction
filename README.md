# ExamplePythonServerlessFunction

To create this project I used [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python).

I created two scripts can be used to create every necessary resource in the azure cloud and to publish this function app. Those scripts are based on azure documentation pages: [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-python) amd [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python).

This project uses [https://github.com/PawelBogdan/AdditionalLibrary](https://github.com/PawelBogdan/AdditionalLibrary) as an external dependency.

The aim of this project is to show how to create an Azure Python Function App which uses an external dependency, e.g. the dependency which cannot be fount in Python Packages Index.

I am not able to do so far. Any advices are nicely seen.
